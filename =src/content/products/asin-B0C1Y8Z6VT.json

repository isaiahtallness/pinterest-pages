I am loving this new holder so much! The old one would grab on with arms and charge my phone, so I do miss the charging feature but I like the magnetic hold even more and I actually like that if I take off the phone temporarily then my cable is still plugged in and I don’t have to pause charging. It adjusts more smoothly than the old one and doesn’t sag over time and need to be retightened. The magnet did hold my iPhone directly but a little bump would make it fall, so I stuck the magnetic circle on that it came with and it holds STRONG! It doesn’t move a millimeter during bumps. The magnetic circle itself is unobtrusive and so far is staying on my phone solidly. This holder is smaller and is whisper quiet, my old one would rattle and was very annoying.

Pros:  Strong Magnetic Hold: The 20 built-in magnets provide a firm grip, even on bumpy roads, ensuring my phone stays in place.  Sleek and Compact Design: The mount's minimalistic look complements my car's interior without being obtrusive.  Versatile Mounting Options: Compatible with both dashboard and vent installations, offering flexibility based on your preference.  Cons:  Adhesive Durability: Some users have reported that the adhesive may weaken over time, leading to potential slippage.  Compatibility with Non-MagSafe Cases: While it works well with MagSafe-compatible cases, users with non-MagSafe cases might need to use the included metal plates, which can affect the aesthetics of the phone.  Potential Breakage: A few users have mentioned that the mount's vent attachment may break after extended use.  Overall, the Kaistyle MagSafe Car Mount offers excellent magnetic strength and a sleek design, making it a great choice for iPhone users.

I just wanted a simple, no-hassle mount for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and this one totally nailed it.  First off — it actually works with MagSafe. No weird metal plates or clunky attachments. Just snap the phone on and it stays put. I’ve hit speed bumps, taken sharp turns, and even slammed the brakes once, and my phone didn’t budge.  The adhesive is solid. Like, really solid. I stuck it on my dashboard, and it’s been rock steady ever since. No peeling off in the heat, no slow slide after a week — it just stays where you put it.  What I love most is how small and clean it looks. It doesn’t block my view or clutter up the dash. And I can still rotate my phone any way I want with just one hand — super handy when switching between directions and music.  Also worth mentioning: my partner uses an Android and just stuck one of the included metal rings on their case — works just as well.  Honestly, I didn’t expect to be writing a five-star review for a car mount, but here we are. If you’ve got a MagSafe iPhone and want something simple that just works, this is a no-brainer.
