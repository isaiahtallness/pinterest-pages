      "title": "Simple, Reliable Bluetooth Upgrade for Older Cars",
      "body": "I’m using this COMSOON Bluetooth adapter to bring wireless music and hands-free calls to my older car, and it works really well for the price. Setup was easy — I just connected it via the 3.5mm AUX jack and powered it through USB. It pairs quickly with my phone and streams audio clearly.  One small note: when both the AUX and USB are plugged in, there’s a little feedback at times. It’s not a dealbreaker, just something to be aware of depending on your car’s setup.  Overall, this is a solid Bluetooth upgrade for any vehicle that doesn’t have built-in wireless. It’s compact, easy to use, and adds a lot of convenience for music and calls. Definitely worth the value — I’d recommend it to anyone looking to modernize their car audio without installing a new stereo. Read more",
