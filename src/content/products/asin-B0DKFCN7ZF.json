I notice the dividers are not removable, and the nine dividers have varied distances between them. I see there are 8 rows to fit mobile devices, with the two rows in the center wide enough to fit multiple thin devices (at least two). I have a rubberized line on each side to prevent devices from slipping out, and I count 5 rubber feet - 1 on each corner and one in the very center. I find its power cord is about 58” long and two-pronged. When I plug it in, I see a small green light near the right front corner. I have two USB-A ports - one on the very left and one on the right - with 8 USB-C ports between them. The outputs vary between 20 up to 140 watts. The two USB-A ports can each deliver a maximum of 60 watts, I have two USB-C ports that each can deliver up to 20 watts, 2 USB-C ports that can deliver up to 45 watts, 2 USB-C ports that can deliver up to 65 watts, and two USB-C (PD 3.1) ports that each can deliver up to 140 watts. From what I understand in the manual, the charger can deliver up to 600 watts in total to 10 connected devices. According to the manual, the charger has short circuit protection and over-voltage protection, and it claims the plastic housing is made of fireproof material. I see it’s made in China and works with AC 100–240 volts, and it has RoHS, FCC, and CE certifications. My experience with charging is that not all devices are compatible, and I notice most of my tablets with USB-C charging ports just charge at around 10 or 11 watts according to the built-in energy meter in my charging cable. However, I can use it to charge my solar power generator at 60 watts, the maximum speed.
