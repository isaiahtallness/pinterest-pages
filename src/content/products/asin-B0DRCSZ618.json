      "body": "I bought this because even though the Apple Magsafe Gen 2 charger (braided cable one) says its Qi2 certified, it ONLY slow charged my S25 Edge at 7.5-10 Watts! While even my Qi2 car charger charged at full 15 Watt speed. At first I was concerned that the base wasn't as flat as the apple one (Hence I bought the apple one first). But in actual use, the phone didn't wobble as I thought it would while charging. Been using Anker products for 10+ years now. Other than an Anker branded desk lamp, none of the 40+ products I bought from them hasn't let me down even to this day. To any S25 users wondering, while using this charger the lock screen show \"Fast Wireless charging\" meaning its charging at the designed 15 Watts. I recommend using a USB-C charger brick that is 20 Watts or more. Read more",
