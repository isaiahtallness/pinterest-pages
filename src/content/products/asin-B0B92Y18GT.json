      "body": "The scent is beautiful. It's a sweet, spicy and vanilla scent that is good year round in my opinion. The fragrance quality is good and comparable to other brands that cost much more. This is my first Lataffa purchase and hopefully, won't be my last. The brand is affordable and I like the presentation of the bottles and the scents are nice. If I had to give one critique it would be that the fragrance doesn't last long, but, the fragrance that it's duping doesn't last long either so it's comparable. Read more",
