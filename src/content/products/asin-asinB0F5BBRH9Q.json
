At regular price, there are some better values on the market. It's tiny, comes with a bracket to mount it on the back of a monitor or to a wall or other surface if desired, and also includes HDMI and power cables. The power cable is a box-type plug with about a 5-6 foot cable and a barrel connector. It has WiFi and wired connectivity, and an SSD and RAM for decent performance. It can be a little slow when it comes to heavier computing, as I've noticed some dips in performance during major Windows updates, but for the most part it's a snappy little machine for basic use.  This isn't intended to be a gaming PC, but a low-power small system for just about whatever use you might have for something like this. It can go almost anywhere, and the fan is fairly quiet. Windows 11 Pro is included, along with some basic software. My primary complaint with this system is that it had both Microsoft 365 and OneNote in virtually every language available preinstalled, which is excessive. That necessitates removal of each one that a user doesn't want or need individually, which is tedious and time-consuming. If they wanted to include all to cover all bases for every potential customer, they should have included installation files for each, not preinstalled them all, as that just adds unnecessary bloat to the system.  Aside from that, it's actually fairly lightweight, and there isn't much but the basic OS here. This is powerful enough to be a small server for something like Minecraft or Nextcloud, or even a small media server if some extra storage were added.

I'm using this one now as a small work PC to run some communications software and mainly a web browser with a few sites open for tasks and reference, and it works well for that.
