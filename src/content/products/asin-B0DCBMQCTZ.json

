This little gadget is super handy and keeps my devices juiced up no matter where I am.  Design and Build Quality: the future starship charger looks pretty slick and feels solid. It's small enough to fit in my bag without any hassle. Plus, it's tough enough to handle the daily grind.  Performance: This thing has a lot of power! It can charge my phone a few times over before it needs a recharge. The fast-charging feature is awesome – my devices get powered up in no time. And with two USB-C ports, I can charge my phone and tablet at the same time.  Ease of Use: Using the charger is a breeze. The LED lights show how much battery is left, so I always know when to plug it in. It even comes with a USB-C cable which is super convenient.  Value for Money: For what it offers it is a great deal. It's reliable and does exactly what I need it to do.  Overall: If you're looking for a solid portable charger, I definitely recommend the Future Starship charger It's become a must-have for me, and I think you'll love it too.

I also really like the LCD on this thing, and it is the only power bank I have bought so far that has a real-time power display built into the power bank itself. Unlike many power banks that show you what voltage and amperage were negotiated, this one displays the real-time wattage that is drawn by the device every half second. So even though your laptop could draw up to 100w, it may only display 22w because that's the amount the laptop is using at that time. Likewise, it also displays the input power at the same time and can be used in a pass-through manner without the USB-C ports reducing its output wattage.  One thing I noticed about this power pack is that it is also able to accept unregulated DC output from my solar panels (using a DC to Type C adapter) @ 24v. This works great on semi-cloudy days when the sun's brightness varies over time and I need a buffer for my laptop when I am working outside. Unlike my other battery packs, this one doesn't let the output voltage drop below 19.5v or so, which means you can generally get the maximum power from your panels without overdrawing the available power. As long as the charging current does not exceed 3A, this setup works extremely well. That being said, there is an internal circuit breaker that stops charging once the charging current goes beyond 3A. If your panel exceeds this amount, using a DC -> EPR adapter may let you charge this more efficiently.
