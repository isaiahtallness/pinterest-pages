      "body": "This is an excellent charger. I tested it out on my iPhone and it sure seemed to charge it faster than usual. It’s a significant upgrade to the one I had previously that just plugged into my car’s USB port. The charger itself seems to be solidly built and just snaps right into your cars power port.

The cord stretches out plenty far and seems to be a nice rubber like material so I’m assuming it’ll be durable and work for years Read more",
