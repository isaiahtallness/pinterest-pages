      "title": "Amazingly useful and saves wear on my iPhone",
      "body": "As somebody with a visual impairment, the fact that this device has no screen doesn’t bother me. Nor does the price. I realize that some people may balk at the $79 per year asking price for the pro plan. As somebody who has historically had to rely on specialist devices for the blind that cost easily $500, even with that $79 per year plan, this thing is a bargain.  While I am giving it five stars, there is something I should make note of. I have enough usable vision where I don’t necessarily need to use speech all the time. Thus, for my needs, the device app is more than adequate. However, for those that do use speech all the time, and might be considering this, I should warn you that the apps accessibility with the VoiceOver screen reader on the iPhone is passable, but you’ll need to sit down and learn it because not everything is labeled properly. Nor are you able to navigate your summary by headings. The mind map is an inaccessible image with no alt text. These are suggestions that I’ve passed along to the development team and since it’s on the software side, these things could be easily implemented overtime, so let’s hope that they get implemented.  For those of you who are wondering if it is worth the cost? My personal belief is that it is because this way you will save wear and tear on your phone’s battery, you won’t have to worry about constantly monitoring your screen to make sure the phone doesn’t go to sleep, plus the ChatGPT transcription features are superior to what Apple Intelligence does, especially when it comes to the summary.  The device itself is really awesome. It’s about the size of two credit cards and at the very top is a concave round button to the left of which is a vertically oriented two position switch. That two position switch is what will swap between regular note dictation mode and phone call dictation mode The button is utilized to start and stop recordings. Beyond that, everything else is done in the app. On the back, and you might need to find it, at the bottom, you will find an oval with four round circles in it. This is your charging port. To make things easier to find I would highly recommend putting it in the included leather case. Another really neat feature about the case is the fact that it can magnetically clip to the back of your phone using MagSafe.  The battery in this thing is incredible and so far the summarization through chat, GPT has been fantastic. I plan to use this at a conference in a couple of months and I’ve already used it at a webinar for my work. I really hope the development continues on this because this is very promising. Keep up the good work. :-) Read more",
