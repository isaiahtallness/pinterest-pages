I bought this myself and am not compensated for this review in any way.  For starters, for this price, I do think this is the best option for a 100W+ charging station. I tested it with devices capable of 100W charging, and it charged at a full 100W as long as the 100W device was the only device plugged in, which is typical of all of these types of charging stations, including pricier options like Anker and UGreen, etc.  Even though it should be capable of charging the 100W device with another 40W to spare, it will downgrade the 100W to 65W if you plug anything else in, which is still pretty good and typical of anything in this niche (look at the specs on all of these if you're shopping around, many will downgrade to 25W when charging more than one device, regardless of the total rated wattage, which sucks if you need to charge two laptops while both people are using them, most newer laptops charge at 65W or more).  Two things led to me sending this back, though, and buying an Anker unit that was, to be fair, twice the price:  1) It gets pretty hot, even when not charging, so I'm skeptical of the longevity. I compared it A to B with an Anker unit I already have, and when charging one device at just 45W, this unit still got to 125F within a few minutes. That's probably fine but if that's how hot the outside is, the inside is much hotter, and so while within tolerances it's going to have some effect on how long it is until capacitors fail and the unit stops working.  It's not a fire hazard or anything, but it's not a sign of something high quality. By contrast, my similar Anker unit stayed at room temperature while charging at 100W.  2) Okay, this one really seems to be just me, but I personally can't stand how many Chinese electronics products have really dorky names. I work in tech and have US-based coworkers who have spent plenty of time Shenzhen. There are lots of English speakers there. If you're going to spend a ton of money on R&D and manufacturing, and you're going to sell the product to English speakers, pay an English speaking marketing firm a few bucks to come up with a decent name.
