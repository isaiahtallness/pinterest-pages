Hey guys so I’d like to start by saying I absolutely adore this powerbank I love batteries and solar stuff in general and I just love the way this powerbank feels in the hand the capacity is pretty true enough to specs it’ll charge my iPhone 11 Pro Max from 0 to 100% using 100% down to 84% of its starting power. Of course you do tend to get the less drain when the bank is high percent. So maybe it would take say 20% of its numerical value from 40% and under to charge same said phone. However this has been a near daily partner for me love love love it. I used the 20k version I’d say a good 6 months or longer before they invented this 25k unit. Love them both and I would say the 20k has juuuuust about the same capacity almost identical in real world use just about down to the percent guys. Except this bad boy can output 65 watts for the big boy devices. And what’s better is is can solar charge off a small foldable 60 watt panel at 45 watts in 65 out. So this guy charges pretty quick in about 2 hours. But mines always less cause I take care of my batteries and I very rarely ever let my lithium batterys drop below say 30s percent. And I don’t think this boy has ever been close 0% and only 100% maybe 6-10 times max I always try to keep it around 50-80% I think it has held its capacity great absolutely great I can’t notice a real world difference in percent loss when charging since day one and i use (2) phones at work daily. Love the powerbank live the carring case it comes with it’s just a nice soft sell formed rubber coating and just feels quality and solid weight in the hand no rattles just a solid brick in stylish formate with a great (percentage based display) I love being able to offer my family charges while on trips to church ect and brag about the banks performance and stellar recharge (itself) time. It charges 3 times faster then it’s 20k little brother and can triple the power out for devices. I’d say their is a bit of a let down as this power bank isnit pps compatible charger. And that’s basically needed to fast charge say my Samsung ultra 2023 at 2.0 max speed. Samsung requires a charger to be pps. I guess it’s basically like a chip that slows the charger to talk to Samsung phones or maybe other devices and androids. However that’s to achieve fast charge 2.0 display to pop up on the s23 ultra to say hey I’m getting like a lot of watts (up to 40). However this power bank gets the job done just fine and plenty quickly enough as the s23 ultra don’t really ever use 45 watts unless it’s really really low and even that’s temporary. So you hardly notice much a difference in using this power bank opposed to a 45 watt (pps) wall charger. You may get from say 30% to 85% 5 or 7 minutes faster so but the time you really notice it’s already been those extra handful of minutes and it’s sitting at 85% so still plenty fast enough so won’t doc it to hard there. However I will say I take such good care of this bank it’s my daily companion and I was pretty dissapointed today that the 65 watt port the (charging the bank port) no longer functions. I trued different cables and then eventually tried to detail clean it being gentle however it simple has given out. Now let’s see how iniu as a company responds and will get back to you guys for an update! By the way the other ports are working flawless and the capacity is still spot on. I do however wish at least one other port could take over the responsibility of recharging the unit itself as guys your relying on one port significantly to keep this powerbank lasting for years and unfortunately even with good care this all important 65 watt port decided it would it call it a day for good. However I will update you guys and see if iniu will step up and stand behind thier power banks! That’s for the read sorry about the length :))) I’ll update my rating after we see how it’s handled thanks guys! UPDATE *** 11/13/23 I’m very happy to say both Amazon and Iniu both had great reps and they had sent me a new unit out with all the bells and whistles. A new carry bag and two new cables just like buying it brand new. I would like to change my review to 5 stars simple because I truly do love this unit. Iniu is one of the good ones who do actually put the amount of mAH in their battery banks. You’ll get plenty of goo steady power from this champion and I put it to the test for over the 7 months. Everywhere I went it went suppling power two 2 phones (one on hotspot). You’ll love the feel of this case and the easy read (%) display. Battery bar displays are a no go for me I really like to know the exact amount of power that I’m using and what I have left. It also allows me to monitor the capacity as when I first charged my iPhone 11 Pro Max for 0% to 100% the battery bank went from 100% to 84%. That’s good to know as time goes by to see if you end up around the same. And I’m happy to say this champ was about in the exact same percent over daily use for 7 months. I also was using a 45 watt charger a decent portion of the time so the 65 watt port was well used and ports do unfortunately fail from time to time. But it’s a good test for iniu to see how how they approach their warranty. And I’m happy to say they backed it up 100%. Their warranty says they’ll replace your unit with a refurbished if they have then stock if not you’ll get s brand new unit. This one has what looks to be (possibly) the smallest little pinprick on one side where maybe they had repaired it… but it could be just a little speck of of torn rubber sticking up. However this unit is more prestine then my first that had scratches on the lcd screen. This one’s flawless besides the little thing in mentioned. Overall I can say I’m very satisfied with both Amazon rep I talked to and iniu who made sure I was taken well care of without sending anything back or to much hoops to jump through they got me set back up with go to companion once again and I’m very thankful to Amazon but Expecially iniu they passed the test guys so you won’t have to worry if your bank kills over from a port or something months down the road even 2 or 3 year I presume so out it to use and enjoy the convenience the comfort and feel of this premium power bank and know if anything goes wrong with it your covered. I’ll update again if anything happens with this one. In the meantime i may consider using about a 30 watt charger to charge the unit. Just because it can charge at 45 watts doesnit relaky mean you Must charge at max speed everytime. But the battery stew didnit mind it and no other port failed so it could be absolutely fine. It’s just eh if im not rushing to charge I may opt to enjoy still good speeds around 30 or so maybe 36 watts that would give my belkin charger a chance to be used and also may just be a little easier on the all to over used and important 65 watt port. The only post that recharges the unit itself… so guys as I said in the video shew I really do love solar and batterys and geeky powebanks and this one just Feeels so good in the hand you it let’s you know to take care of it you’ll enjoy this one and this company. But just to be sure I’ll update if anything happens :) if not we’ll I’ll be out there somewhere using this powerbank daily once again thanks to iniu :) Read more\",\"asin\":\"B0DBHC9F8B\",\"body_html\":\"<script>   (function() {    P.when(&apos;cr-A&apos;, &apos;ready&apos;).execute(function(A) {     if(typeof A.toggleExpanderAriaLabel === &apos;function&apos;) {      A.toggleExpanderAriaLabel(&apos;review_text_read_more&apos;, &apos;Read more of this review&apos;, &apos;Read less of this review&apos;);     }    });   })();  </script>  <style>   .review-text-read-more-expander:focus-visible {    outline: 2px solid #2162a1;    outline-offset: 2px;    border-radius: 5px;   }  </style> <div data-a-expander-name=\\\"review_text_read_more\\\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\\\"300\\\" class=\\\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container review-text-read-more-expander\\\" style=\\\"max-height:300px\\\"><div data-hook=\\\"review-collapsed\\\" data-expanded=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\\\"><div id=\\\"video-block-R23AY3LUFNLAYE\\\" class=\\\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\\\">                                                  <div id=\\\"review-video-id-R23AY3LUFNLAYE\\\" class=\\\"cr-video-desktop cr-video-desktop-placeholder\\\" data-review-id=\\\"R23AY3LUFNLAYE\\\" data-video-url=\\\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/0ff1055c-13f5-4c8d-9b5d-cfc2c229ece5/default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8\\\" data-closed-captions=\\\"en,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-closed-captions-artifact-us-east-1-prod/closedCaptions/765adf0e-1b1d-4146-8c9b-c1367e5f768f.vtt\\\" data-thumbnail-url=\\\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lRXp8qAAL._SY256.jpg\\\">       <div class=\\\"cr-media-status-container\\\">     <span class=\\\"a-spinner a-spinner-medium cr-media-spinner\\\"/>     <span class=\\\"a-color-inverse cr-media-error-msg\\\">      The media could not be loaded.     </span>    </div>     </div>                </div><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"\\\" value=\\\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/G1ZHsJbd-AL.mp4\\\" class=\\\"video-url\\\"/><input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"\\\" value=\\\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lRXp8qAAL._SY256.jpg\\\" class=\\\"video-slate-img-url\\\"/>             <span>Hey guys so I&#x2019;d like to start by saying I absolutely adore this powerbank I love batteries and solar stuff in general and I just love the way this powerbank feels in the hand the capacity is pretty true enough to specs it&#x2019;ll charge my iPhone 11 Pro Max from 0 to 100% using 100% down to 84% of its starting power.

For college students, travelers, or anybody who wants the most from a power bank, this will definitely help prevent stress induced hair loss. I’ve had my phone die while stranded away from home, and I’ve had my laptop die mid-class. I chose to say bye to those cruel moments.  I chose INIU because it’s definitely the best price to capacity/output while still being trustworthy. I got the classic size 25000 mAh model at 100W and this thing is perfect for my uses. For $10 more you can get a more compact model but this was still lighter than my Lenovo Laptop 170W slim charger while charging other things too. Since the classic size was on sale I went for the cheaper option. Great for gaming laptops if that’s your need. I get a few more hours out of mine, definitely makes the difference and eases the blow from not choosing a laptop that can't game.  Which, this is definitely more for users of laptops or any other power hungry devices. Most other things won’t support 100W charging so your money is better spent on cheaper models. 20k mAh at 65W is probably the highest I’d go if I didn’t have a laptop.  The 100W output is the main attraction here, my gaming laptop dies quickly but has a USB-C lightning port. This gives it the perfect power delivery in between it’s 60W minimum and 140W maximum, if you want the fastest charging then obviously buy the 27k mAh at 140W output. Yes the usb-c to usb-c cable they include supports 100W charging! No need to buy another unless you want a longer or more quality cable.  The power bank itself charges admirably fast. I only have a 30W charger in hand for now but even at half of its 65W charging maximum, it’s pretty quick. I usually give myself an hour in the morning to get ready and leave, even if this was at 0% it’ll charge fast enough to get me through the day.  Durability wise this thing is solid. I don’t LOVE the soft touch plastic used, it picks up finger prints and any oil on your hands like nobodies business, but it definitely feels more solid than your run of the mill hard plastic. The thing you want to avoid in a power bank are any cracks or punctures. A hard fall at a bad angle would crack cheaper plastic but not this tough shell. Metal gets hot and doesn’t absorb as much of the impact. So this was definitely the best choice. Maybe it could have a different finish but I usually charge it out of it's little pouch regardless. The only reason to take it out would be for the phone holder.  All in all this is an invaluable purchase. The second I opened this and plugged it into my computer I felt my stress wash away. In 2025 a good power bank is almost necessary. Unless you upgrade phones every other year it’s probably not lasting an entire day of use. I also don’t have to look around the room for outlets to charge my laptop at during class.

I'm able to use this as a backup for my Lenovo non-gaming laptop that can charge with usb-c. You'll need something faster for gaming laptops if you try to use while gaming, or at least I'd expect Windows to complain if you try and only slow down how fast you go through.  Otherwise, for phones/tablets and non-gaming laptops, this is a most excellent battery bank for the price. The display is handy for showing the the current charge and blinks when charging the brick itself. It charges as quick as it discharges, so you don't have to wait a ton of time, though I haven't timed it. Maybe an hour or two from a low state of charge?  It is slightly hefty but not so much that it is a pain to carry around in a laptop bag or something. It's 50/50 if I'd try to pocket it, probably a little too heavy for that.
