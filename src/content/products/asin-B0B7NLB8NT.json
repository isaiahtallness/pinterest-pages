Some didn&apos;t look all that strong enough to hold my 12.9&quot; iPad Pro with case. I thought I could build an organizer but I&apos;m already out of chargers. So I found this SIIG. It&apos;s a little thicker than what I would like but it fits the bill.<br/>The wireless charging works great and so does all the slots for holding the devices. The only thing that I would like better is that the USB C port could charge at least 65 watts (it&apos;s only 15).<br/>It is fantastic and would recommend it.<br/></span>   </div><div class=\\\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\\\"><div class=\\\"a-expander-content-fade\\\"/><a href=\\\"javascript:void(0)\\\" data-hook=\\\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\\\" aria-label=\\\"Read more of this review\\\" aria-expanded=\\\"false\\\" role=\\\"button\\\" data-action=\\\"a-expander-toggle\\\" class=\\\"a-declarative\\\" data-a-expander-toggle=\\\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\\\"><i class=\\\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\\\"/><span class=\\\"a-expander-prompt\\\">Read more</span></a></div></div>\",\"link\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HT76ONN23UB6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B7NLB8NT\",\"rating\":5,\"date\":{\"raw\":\"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019\",\"utc\":\"2019-01-29T00:00:00.000Z\"},\"profile\":{\"name\":\"Steiners\",\"link\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJUQN27A2WYVCLAMMVRVJS7METQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8\",\"id\":\"AFJUQN27A2WYVCLAMMVRVJS7METQ\"},\"vine_program\":false,\"verified_purchase\":true,\"helpful_votes\":3,\"review_country\":\"us\",\"is_global_review\":false,\"review_attributes\":[{\"Color\":\"Black 90W (9A1C) + Qi\"}]},{\"id\":\"RJICUD8Z9US47\",\"title\":\"Defectuoso\",\"body\":\"El dispositivo de funcionar al poco tiempo Read more\",\"body_html\":\"<script>   (function() {    P.when(&apos;cr-A&apos;, &apos;ready&apos;).execute(function(A) {     if(typeof A.toggleExpanderAriaLabel === &apos;function&apos;) {      A.toggleExpanderAriaLabel(&apos;review_text_read_more&apos;, &apos;Read more of this review&apos;, &apos;Read less of this review&apos;);     }    });   })();  </script>  <style>   .review-text-read-more-expander:focus-visible {    outline: 2px solid #2162a1;    outline-offset: 2px;    border-radius: 5px;   }  </style> <div data-a-expander-name=\\\"review_text_read_more\\\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\\\"300\\\" class=\\\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container review-text-read-more-expander\\\" style=\\\"max-height:300px\\\"><div data-hook=\\\"review-collapsed\\\" data-expanded=\\\"false\\\" class=\\\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\\\">           <span class=\\\"cr-original-review-content\\\">El dispositivo de funcionar al poco tiempo<br/></span><span class=\\\"cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden\\\"/>     </div><div class=\\\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\\\"><div class=\\\"a-expander-content-fade\\\"/><a href=\\\"javascript:void(0)\\\" data-hook=\\\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\\\" aria-label=\\\"Read more of this review\\\" aria-expanded=\\\"false\\\" role=\\\"button\\\" data-action=\\\"a-expander-toggle\\\" class=\\\"a-declarative\\\" data-a-expander-toggle=\\\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\\\"><i class=\\\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\\\"/><span class=\\\"a-expander-prompt\\\">Read more</span></a></div></div>\",\"rating\":1,\"date\":{\"raw\":\"Reviewed in Mexico on February 21, 2021\",\"utc\":\"2021-02-21T00:00:00.000Z\"},\"profile\":{\"name\":\"Cliente de Amazon\"},\"vine_program\":false,\"verified_purchase\":true,\"review_country\":\"mx\",\"is_global_review\":true,\"review_attributes\":[{\"Color\":\"Black 90W (9A1C) + Qi\"}]}]"
