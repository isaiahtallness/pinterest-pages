This is normal and does not affect quality. To restore its original solid texture, please place the sealed jar in the refrigerator for at least 1.5 hours before opening.

      "body": "The Crowned Skin King Body Butter is hands down one of the best skincare products I have ever used. From the moment you open the jar, the scent is smooth, rich, and masculine. Subtle enough for daily wear but powerful enough to get noticed. The texture is creamy and melts right into the skin without feeling greasy. My skin stays moisturized and soft all day, especially in those dry areas like elbows and knees.  I have had women compliment me multiple times on how good I smell, even when I am not wearing cologne. When I really want to turn things up, I will layer it with my favorite fragrance and it just hits different, like luxury and confidence wrapped in one.  This is not just body butter, it is a whole vibe. Perfect addition to any man’s grooming routine. Highly recommended if you want to treat your skin and your presence like royalty. Read more",
