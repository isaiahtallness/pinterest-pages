      "body": "The noise cancelling is surprisingly good — it blocks out traffic and other background noise without that weird pressure feeling some earbuds give. Super comfortable to wear for long periods, and no headaches at all.  I love the transparency mode — I use it when walking around the city so I can still hear what’s going on around me. It works really well and sounds natural.  Battery life has been great so far. A quick 15-minute charge has saved me more than once, and the case lasts forever between charges.  Also, no lag when watching videos or playing mobile games, which is a huge plus.  Sound quality is excellent — I usually keep it on Signature Mode, but Bass Mode is fun for workouts or more energetic music.  Overall, they’re solid, reliable, and sound way better than I expected at this price. Definitely a good buy! Read more",
